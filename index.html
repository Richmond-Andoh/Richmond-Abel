            Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 â€“ 20 March 1726/27)
            was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, 
            theologian, and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher"), 
            widely recognised as one of the greatest 
            mathematicians and physicists and among the most influential scientists of all time.

              About the Legend
          </h1>
          <p>
            Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity
            <br> <br>
            Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.
            <br><br> He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. 
            <br><br> Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.
            <br><br>
            Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.
            <br><br> His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704
